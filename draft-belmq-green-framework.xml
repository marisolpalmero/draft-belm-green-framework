<t>Recognizing the urgent need for energy efficiency, this document specifies a management framework focused on devices and device components within, or connected to, interconnected systems. The framework aims to enable energy usage optimization, based on the network condition while achieving the network's functional and performance requirements (e.g., improving overall network utilization) and also ensure interoperability across diverse systems. Leveraging data from existing use cases, it delivers actionable metrics to support effective energy management and informed decision-making. Furthermore, the framework proposes mechanisms for representing and organizing timestamped telemetry data using YANG models and metadata, enabling transparent and reliable monitoring. This structured approach facilitates improved energy efficiency through consistent energy management practices.</t>

NOTES:

1. An Energy Management System according to ISO50001 (ISO-EnMS)
   is a set of systems or procedures upon which organizations can
   develop and implement an energy policy, set targets and action
   plans, and take into account legal requirements related to
   energy use.  An ISO-EnMS allows organizations to improve energy
   performance and demonstrate conformity to requirements,
   standards, and/or legal requirements.

2. Example ISO-EnMS: Company A defines a set of policies and
   procedures indicating that there should exist multiple
   computerized systems that will poll energy measurements from
   their meters and pricing / source data from their local
   utility.  Company A specifies that their CFO (Chief Financial
   Officer) should collect information and summarize it quarterly
   to be sent to an accounting firm to produce carbon accounting
   reporting as required by their local government.

3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition herein is the
   preferred meaning of an EnMS.  The definition from ISO50001
   can be referred to as an ISO Energy Management System
   (ISO-EnMS).

        <t>This document uses the terms Power and Energy in accordance with <xref target="GreenTerminology"/>:
- Power refers to the instantaneous rate at which a device consumes or produces electrical energy (typically expressed in Watts).
- Energy, by contrast, represents the cumulative amount of work performed over time (typically expressed in Joules or Watt-hours).
Both concepts are required within this YANG module: Power enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of device operation, while Energy provides a time-integrated view necessary for accounting and reporting. For completeness and alignment with existing operational models and use cases, this specification includes both Power and Energy attributes.</t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="reference-model">
      <name>Reference Model</name>
      <t>The framework introduces the concept of a Power Interface.
   A Power Interface is defined as an interconnection among devices
   where energy can be provided, received, or both. There are some
   similarities between Power Interfaces and network interfaces. A
   network interface can be set to different states, such
   as sending or receiving data on an attached line. Similarly, a Power
   Interface can be receiving or providing energy.</t>
      <t>The most basic example of Energy Management is a single device
   reporting information about itself.  In many cases, however, energy
   is not measured by the device itself but is measured upstream in the
   power distribution tree.  For example, a Power Distribution Unit
   (PDU) may measure the energy it supplies to attached devices and
   report this to an Energy Management System.  Therefore, devices often
   have relationships to other devices or components in the power
   network.  An Energy Management System (EnMS) generally requires an
   understanding of the power topology (who provides power to whom), the
   Metering topology (who meters whom), and the potential Aggregation
   (who aggregates values of others).</t>
      <t>The relationships build on the Power Interface concept.  The
   different relationships among device(s)/component(s), as specified in
   this document, include power source, Metering, and Aggregation
   Relationships.</t>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>The monitoring interface (e) obviously monitor more aspects than just power and energy,
(for example traffic monitoring) but this is not covered in the framework.</t>
      <t>Note that the GREEN framework specifies logical blocks, however, the Energy Efficiency Management function might be implemented inside the device, based in <xref target="RFC8348"/>, in the controller, or a combination of both.</t>
      <t>Even the current reference model implicitly assumes a hierarchical network structure, this assumption acknowledges that modern networks have flatter and anticipate more distributed topologies.</t>
      <t>The reference model covers every network device and component that have a Unique Identifiable ID (UUID) and can represent or influence power or energy consumption. If the component can be uniquely identified, it can be modeled.</t>

          <name>Telemetry Push Pattern</name>
          <t>The framework recommends a push-based telemetry model for energy efficiency data collection, where network devices stream power and energy measurements to management systems rather than waiting for poll requests.</t>
          <t>For energy monitoring specifically, push-based telemetry offers:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Temporal accuracy: Energy consumption varies over time; push models capture variations that polling might miss.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Reduced latency: Anomalies (power spikes, efficiency degradation) are detected immediately.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Network and data collection efficiency: Eliminates repetitive poll/response cycles.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Scalability: Controllers can subscribe once rather than poll continuously.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>Following the YANG-Push approach, several parameters from EMAN <xref target="RFC7460"/> are not needed in this framework:</t>

          <name>Measurement Accuracy and Data Source Classification</name>
          <t>Power and energy data reported by network elements differ significantly in origin and reliability. Some values are derived from calibrated sensors, while others are based on manufacturer specifications, historical observations, or analytical models. To ensure meaningful comparison, aggregation, and interpretation, the framework requires all reported energy-related metrics to include an explicit indication of measurement accuracy.</t>
          <t>The framework defines a common classification of data accuracy covering unknown, estimated, and directly measured values. Measured data is further differentiated by precision levels. This classification enables consumers of the data to assess reliability, prioritize upgrades, support regulatory compliance, and avoid incorrect aggregation or double counting across measurement domains.</t>
          <t>Detailed accuracy categories, and extensibility mechanisms are specified in the GREEN YANG data model <xref target="PowerAndEnergy"/>.</t>

        <section anchor="industry-standard-certifications">
          <name>Industry-Standard Certifications</name>
          <t>In addition to measurement accuracy, the framework supports the reporting of industry-standard energy efficiency certifications, per Energy Object, when available (for example a PSU). These certifications provide vendor- or laboratory-validated benchmarks that characterize the designed efficiency of equipment and components.</t>
          <t>Certification information complements measurement accuracy by providing a stable, device-level reference for procurement, compliance, and lifecycle management, while accuracy indicators describe the reliability of operational measurements. Together, these mechanisms enable informed assessment of both expected and observed energy performance.</t>
          <t>The purpose of this framework and YANG module is not to identify all certifications, but to establish a foundation for future extensions. Detailed certification models and encoding rules are defined in the companion GREEN YANG data model.</t>

        <section anchor="hierarchical-data-model-and-default-value-inheritance">
          <name>Hierarchical Data Model and Default Value Inheritance</name>
          <t>The framework leverages the hierarchical structure of the ietf-hardware model <xref target="RFC8348"/> to minimize redundant data reporting and simplify device implementation. The framework refers as parent-child relationships.</t>
          <t>Energy objects inherit their hierarchical containment relationships from the hardware component tree. For example:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>A chassis(parent) contains line cards(children).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Each line card(parent) contains ports(children).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Each chassis(parent) is powered by power supply units(children).</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>Energy metrics and metadata follow these same hierarchical relationships, enabling:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Child components inherit measurement accuracy from their parent unless explicitly overridden.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Reduced reporting overhead: Devices only transmit accuracy metadata for components that differ from their parent.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Hierarchical validation: Controllers leverage the device containment tree (per <xref target="RFC8348"/>) to verify parent measurements by aggregating child values.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>The YANG data model <xref target="PowerAndEnergy"/> implements hierarchical defaults for key attributes. For example:</t>
          <t>The <tt>data-source-accuracy</tt> leaf has a default value of <tt>accuracy-like-parent</tt>, meaning:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>If a chassis reports <tt>accuracy-measured-gold</tt> (±5%)</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>All child components(line cards, ports, fans) automatically inherit <tt>accuracy-measured-gold</tt></t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Only components with different accuracy need to explicitly report their value</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>Example:
<tt>
Chassis (accuracy: gold ±5%)
├── Line Card 1 (inherits: gold ±5%)  ← No need to report
├── Line Card 2 (inherits: gold ±5%)  ← No need to report
└── PSU 1 (explicit: silver ±10%)     ← Must report (differs from parent)
</tt></t>
          <t>This dramatically reduces YANG-Push telemetry volume while maintaining accuracy transparency.</t>

          <t>While <tt>unit-multiplier</tt> does not inherit, the framework recommends:</t>

            <li>
              <t>Mandatory unit-multiplier specification OR</t>

            <li>
              <t>Default to <tt>multiplier-units</tt> (10^0 = 1) for simplicity</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t><strong>Rationale from WG Discussion:</strong>
&gt; "Either mandatory or default to 1, not inheritance. Leave it open to authors to discuss further." The final YANG model can choose either approach, but must not use inheritance to avoid client code complexity.</t>

          <t>The YANG data model <xref target="PowerAndEnergy"/> introduces a power-factor leaf to capture Power Factor (PF), enabling controller engines to accurately compute real power. PF is essential for accurately estimating real power consumption in AC-powered components, especially Power Supply Units (PSUs).</t>
          <t>The <tt>power-factor</tt> leaf defaults to 100 (unity power factor), meaning:
- Devices with typical resistive loads don't need to report power factor
- Only devices with significant reactive power (motors, large PSUs) need explicit values
- Simplifies data for most networking equipment</t>

          <t>When the EnMS discovers the physical meter, it must know for
which Energy Object(s) it measures power or energy. This is the
Metering Relatonship.</t>
          <t>A Metering Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object
measures power, energy, demand, or Power Attributes of one or more
other Energy Objects.  The Metering Relationship gives the view of
the Metering topology.  Physical meters can be placed anywhere in
a power distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor
and report accumulated power consumption of the entire building.
Logically, the Metering topology overlaps with the wiring
topology, as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A
typical example is meters that clamp onto the existing wiring.</t>

          <t>The most important issue in such a topology is to avoid the double counting in the Energy Management System (EnMS). The physical meter reports the Energy transmitted, while the connected Device/Component might also report its consumed Energy. Those two values are identical. Without the knowledge of this specific topology, that is the Metering Relationship between the two Energy Objects, the EnMS will double count the Energy consumed in the network.</t>

          <t>Double counting is also an issue in such an example. The switch port, via its Power Outlet, reports the Energy transmitted, while the PoE End Point, via its Power Inlet, reports its Energy consumed.</t>
          <t>A second issue in such an example is the control topology. The controller must have the knowledge that, if it shuts down the switch port, it will also switch off the connected PoE End Point, as a consequence. This is the Power Source Relationship.</t>
          <t>A Power Source Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object provides power to one or more Energy Objects. The Power Source Relationship gives a view of the physical wiring topology -- for example, a PoE End Point receiving power from a switch port over PoE or a data center server receiving power from two specific Power Interfaces from two different PDUs.</t>
          <t>On top of that, there might be two control points for the PoE End Point. First the connected switch port but also the controller direct connection to the PoE End Point (f). Via this interface, the controller might for example put the PoE End Point to a lower Power State.</t>

        <name>Relationships</name>
        <t>The framework for Energy Management need to describe a means to monitor and control devices and components, and it needs to describe the relationships among, and connections between, devices and components.</t>
        <t>Two Energy Objects can establish an Energy Object Relationship to model the deployment topology with respect to Energy Management.</t>
        <t>Relationships are modeled with a Relationship that contains the UUID of the other participant in the relationship, along with a Relationship type.</t>
        <t>There are three types of relationships are Power Source, Metering, and Aggregations.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>A Power Source Relationship is a relationship where one Energy
Object provides power to one or more Energy Objects.  The Power
Source Relationship gives a view of the physical wiring topology
-- for example, a data center server receiving power from two
specific Power Interfaces from two different PDUs.  </t>
            <t>
Note: A Power Source Relationship may or may not change as the
direction of power changes between two Energy Objects.  The
relationship may remain to indicate that the change of power
direction was unintended or an error condition.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A Metering Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object
measures power, energy, demand, or Power Attributes of one or more
other Energy Objects.  The Metering Relationship gives the view of
the Metering topology.  Physical meters can be placed anywhere in
a power distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor
and report accumulated power consumption of the entire building.
Logically, the Metering topology overlaps with the wiring
topology, as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A
typical example is meters that clamp onto the existing wiring.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>An Aggregation Relationship is a relationship where one Energy
Object aggregates Energy Management information of one or more
other Energy Objects.  The Aggregation Relationship gives a model
of devices that may aggregate (sum, average, etc.) values for
other devices.  The Aggregation Relationship is slightly different
compared to the other relationships, as this refers more to a
management function.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>To prevent double counting in scenarios where one Energy Object provides power to another (e.g., PoE switch port to PoE endpoint):</t>
        <t>Convention: Report both consumed and delivered energy separately:
- The providing Energy Object reports total-energy-consumed (self) AND total-energy-delivered (to downstream)
- The receiving Energy Object reports total-energy-consumed</t>
        <t>Example: A PoE switch port consuming 1W and providing 9W to an endpoint:
- Port reports: total-energy-consumed=1W, total-energy-produced=9W
- Endpoint reports: total-energy-consumed=9W</t>
        <t>Controllers must use Metering Relationships to identify and avoid aggregating both values.</t>
        <t>In some situations, it is not possible to discover the Energy Object Relationships, and an EnMS or administrator must manually set them.  Given that relationships can be assigned manually, the following sections describe guidelines for use.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="power-state-set">
        <name>Power State Set</name>
        <t>The Energy Object contains a Power State Set attribute that represents
a set of Power States a device or component supports.</t>
        <t>A Power State describes a condition or mode of a device or component.
While Power States are typically used for control, they may be used
for monitoring only.</t>
        <t>A device or component is expected to support at least one set of
Power States consisting of at least two states: an on state and an
off state.</t>
        <t>The semantics of a Power State are specified by:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>The functionality provided by an Energy Object in this state.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A limitation of the power that an Energy Object uses in this
 state.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A combination of the first two.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>The semantics of a Power State should be clearly defined.  Limitation
(curtailment) of the power used by an Energy Object in a state may be
specified by:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>An absolute power value.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>A percentage value of power relative to the Energy Object's
Nameplate Power.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>An indication of power relative to another Power State.  For
example, specify that power in state A is less than in state B.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>For supporting Power State management, an Energy Object provides
statistics on Power States, including the time an Energy Object
spent in a certain Power State and the number of times an Energy
Object entered a Power State.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>There are many existing standards describing device and component
Power States. TO BE COMPLETED</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="power-state-set-mapping-and-intent">
        <name>Power State Set Mapping and Intent</name>
        <t>Defining and enforcing power states can be challenging, because each Energy Object's technical capabilities must be mapped to high-level operational intents for energy-efficient operation. The following examples illustrate how an Energy Object's power-saving capabilities can be aligned with typical intents:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>running at reduced capacity during predictable low-demand periods;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>lowering energy use while maintaining required performance levels;</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>operating at a reduced service level when the site is on a backup power source during a grid outage.</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>By expressing such intents, a controller can decide which power state an Energy Object should enter at any given time and under what conditions.</t>
        <section anchor="capability-discovery">
          <name>Capability Discovery</name>
          <t>Identifying what power states an Energy Object supports is crucial for onboarding and integration, especially for legacy systems. Key discovery elements include:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>Whether the energy object supports multiple Power State Sets.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Semantics and limitations of each state (e.g., absolute power, relative power).</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Transition characteristics, such as the time required to move between states.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Energy Object-specific state transition constraints like frequency, which may limit energy-saving measures to avoid damaging the device/components.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Impacts on measurement accuracy.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section anchor="intent-mapping">
          <name>Intent Mapping</name>
          <t>The goal of intent mapping is to translate high-level energy-saving intents into specific device/component configurations. For example:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>An intent like "reduce power consumption at low utilization" might map to a predefined low-power state.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>Controllers may interpret intents variably, e.g., "run at half capacity but be ready to scale up if needed."</t>
            </li>

      <name>Use Case Implementation Requirements: Device vs. Controller Centric</name>
      <t>This section analyzes the <xref target="GreenUseCases"/> to identify which capabilities require device-level implementation versus controller orchestration. This guides implementers on device feature priorities and operators on controller capabilities needed for effective energy management.</t>
      <t>The framework distinguishes between two orthogonal concepts:</t>
      <section anchor="implementation-focus-where-intelligence-resides">
        <name>Implementation Focus: Where Intelligence Resides</name>
        <t>Device-Centric Use Cases require autonomous on-device decision-making:
- Example: UC 14 (Power Shortage) - Device must independently manage backup power transitions when network connectivity is lost.
- It might require local algorithms, minimal controller dependency, autonomous operation, etc.</t>
        <t>Controller-Centric Use Cases require centralized orchestration and network-wide visibility:
- Example: UC 10 (Fixed Network Saving) - Controller predicts traffic patterns across devices and coordinates state changes.
- It requires cross-device coordination, centralized intelligence</t>
        <t>Hybrid Use Cases need both device capabilities and controller coordination:
- Example: UC 9 (WLAN Energy Saving) - Devices support power modes; controller coordinates AP groups to maintain coverage.</t>
        <t>Who triggers telemetry is independent of implementation focus and follows YANG-Push <xref target="RFC8641"/> patterns:</t>
        <t>Controller-Initiated, or Dynamic subscription:
- Controller establishes YANG-Push subscriptions to energy objects
- Device streams telemetry at specified intervals (periodic) or on change (event-driven)
- Centralized monitoring policy management</t>
        <t>Device-Initiated, or Static Subscription:
- Device autonomously pushes alerts without prior subscription
- Used for threshold violations, hardware failures, certification degradation
- Complements controller-initiated monitoring</t>
        <t>Even device-centric use cases(autonomous operation) typically use controller-initiated telemetry (controller subscribes to observe device behavior). These concepts are independent.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>Resiliency is an implicit use case of energy efficiency management
which comes with numerous security considerations :</t>
      <t>Controlling Power State and power supply of entities are considered
highly sensitive actions, since they can significantly affect the
operation of directly and indirectly connected devices.  Therefore,
all control actions must be sufficiently protected through
authentication, authorization, and integrity protection mechanisms.</t>
      <t>Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly on the
public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause of risk, for
example, if the remote control functions can be exercised on those
devices from anywhere on the Internet.</t>
      <t>The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity as addressed
can be used to derive more information than just the received and
provided energy; therefore, monitored data requires protection.
This protection includes authentication and authorization of entities
requesting access to monitored data as well as confidentiality
protection during transmission of monitored data.  Privacy of stored
data in an entity must be taken into account.  Monitored data may be
used as input to control, accounting, and other actions, so integrity
of transmitted information and authentication of the origin may be
needed.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>   Energy-efficient network management is primarily meant to enhance
   conventional network management with energy-related management
   capabilities that optimize overall network energy consumption.  To
   that aim, specific features and capabilities are required to control
   (and thus optimize) the energy use of involved network elements and
   their components.

   This document defines a set of key terms used within the IETF when
   discussing energy efficiency in network management.  Such reference
   document helps framing discussion and agreeing upon a set of main
   concepts in this area.

              <t>This document defines a framework for Energy Management (EMAN) for devices and device components within, or connected to, communication networks. The framework presents a physical reference model and information model. The information model consists of an Energy Management Domain as a set of Energy Objects. Each Energy Object can be attributed with identity, classification, and context. Energy Objects can be monitored and controlled with respect to power, Power State, energy, demand, Power Attributes, and battery. Additionally, the framework models relationships and capabilities between Energy Objects.</t>
