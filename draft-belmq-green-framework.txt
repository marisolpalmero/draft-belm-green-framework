               Framework for Energy Efficiency Management
                   draft-belmq-green-framework-latest

Abstract

   Recognizing the urgent need for energy efficiency, this document
   emphasizes the establishment of a management framework within the
   GREEN Working Group to standardize processes, optimize energy usage,
   and ensure interoperability.  This framework will leverage collected
   data from existing use cases to deliver actionable metrics for
   optimized energy management and informed decision-making.
   Furthermore, the document proposes a framework for collecting
   timestamped telemetry data across domains, using YANG, metadata, and
   Time Series Databases for transparent and dependable results.

1.  Introduction

   In reference to https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-stephan-green-
   use-cases/, analyzing use cases such as the "Incremental Application
   of the GREEN Framework" and "Consideration of other domains for
   obtention of end-to-end metrics", it reveals the critical need for a
   structured approach to transitioning network devices towards energy-
   efficient operations.  The framework is essential for:

   *  Standardization: Ensuring consistent practices across different
      devices and network segments to facilitate interoperability.

   *  Efficient Energy Management: Providing guidelines to identify
      inefficiencies and implement improvements.

   *  Scalability: Offering solutions that accommodate growing network
      demands and complexity.

   *  Cost Reduction: Optimizing energy usage to lower operational costs
      and extend equipment lifecycles.

   *  Competitiveness: Enabling organizations to maintain a competitive
      edge through enhanced sustainability.

   *  Environmental Impact: Supporting broader sustainability
      initiatives by reducing carbon footprints.

   *  Simplified Implementation: Streamlining the deployment of energy-
      efficient measures to minimize service disruptions.

   *  Security: Protecting sensitive operations related to power states
      and consumption.

2.  Motivation

2.1.  Impact on Energy Metrics

   The framework will significantly enhance the creation of energy
   metrics with actionable insights by:

   *  Standardizing Metrics: Establishing consistent measurement
      protocols for energy consumption and efficiency.

   *  Enhancing Data Collection: Facilitating comprehensive monitoring
      and data aggregation across devices.

   *  Supporting Real-time Monitoring: Enabling dynamic tracking and
      immediate optimization of energy usage.

   *  Integration Across Devices: Ensuring interoperability for network-
      wide data analysis.

   *  Providing Actionable Insights: Translating raw data into
      meaningful information for decision-making.

2.2.  Current Device Readiness

   While many modern networking devices have basic energy monitoring
   capabilities, these are often proprietary.  The framework will define
   requirements to enhance these capabilities, enabling standardized
   metric production and meaningful data contributions for energy
   management goals.

2.3.  Why Now?

   The decision to define the framework now, rather than later, is
   driven by:

   *  Immediate Benefits: Start realizing cost savings, reduced carbon
      footprints, and improved efficiencies.

   *  Rapid Technological Advancements: Aligning the framework with
      current technologies to prevent obsolescence.

   *  Increasing Energy Demands: Mitigating the impact of growing energy
      consumption on costs and sustainability.

   *  Regulatory Pressure: Preparing for compliance with existing and
      anticipated sustainability regulations.

   *  Competitive Advantage: Positioning organizations as leaders in
      sustainability and innovation.

   *  Foundational Work Ready: Building on the use cases and
      requirements established in Phase I.

   *  Proactive Risk Management: Minimizing risks associated with energy
      costs and environmental factors.

   *  Facilitate Future Innovations: Creating a platform for continuous
      improvements and adaptations.

   *  Stakeholder Engagement: Ensuring diverse perspectives are
      reflected for broader adoption.

   In conclusion, establishing the framework for energy efficiency
   management now is strategic and timely, leveraging the current
   momentum of use cases and requirements to drive meaningful progress
   in energy efficiency management.  Delaying its development could
   result in missed opportunities for immediate benefits, increased
   costs, and challenges in adapting to future technological and
   regulatory landscapes.

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

5.  Security Considerations

   Resiliency is an implicit use case of energy efficiency management
   which comes with numerous security considerations :

   Controlling Power State and power supply of entities are considered
   highly sensitive actions, since they can significantly affect the
   operation of directly and indirectly connected devices.  Therefore,
   all control actions must be sufficiently protected through
   authentication, authorization, and integrity protection mechanisms.

   Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly on the
   public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause of risk, for
   example, if the remote control functions can be exercised on those
   devices from anywhere on the Internet.

   The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity as addressed
   can be used to derive more information than just the received and
   provided energy; therefore, monitored data requires protection.  This
   protection includes authentication and authorization of entities
   requesting access to monitored data as well as confidentiality
   protection during transmission of monitored data.  Privacy of stored
   data in an entity must be taken into account.  Monitored data may be
   used as input to control, accounting, and other actions, so integrity
   of transmitted information and authentication of the origin may be
   needed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
