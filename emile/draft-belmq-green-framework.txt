               Framework for Energy Efficiency Management
                   draft-belmq-green-framework-latest

Abstract

   Recognizing the urgent need for energy efficiency, this document
   specifies a management framework focused on devices and device
   components within, or connected to, interconnected systems.  The
   framework aims to enable energy usage optimization, base on the
   network condition while achieving the networkâ€™s functional and
   performance requirements (e.g., improving overall network
   utilization) and also ensure interoperability across diverse systems.
   Leveraging data from existing use cases, it delivers actionable
   metrics to support effective energy management and informed decision-
   making.  Furthermore, the framework proposes mechanisms for
   representing and organizing timestamped telemetry data using YANG
   models and metadata, enabling transparent and reliable monitoring.
   This structured approach facilitates improved energy efficiency
   through consistent energy management practices.

2.  Introduction

   In reference to [I-D.stephan-green-use-cases], analyzing use cases
   such as the "Incremental Application of the GREEN Framework" and
   "Consideration of other domains for obtention of end-to-end metrics",
   it reveals the critical need for a structured approach to
   transitioning network devices' management towards energy-efficient
   operations.  The framework is essential for:

   *  Standardization: Ensuring consistent practices across different
      devices and network segments to facilitate interoperability.

   *  Energy Efficiency Management: Providing guidelines to identify
      inefficiencies, look for the balance between energy usage and
      network/resource/component/capability utilization and implement
      improvements.

   *  Scalability: Offering solutions that accommodate growing network
      demands and complexity.

   *  Cost Reduction: Optimizing energy usage to lower operational costs
      and extend equipment lifecycles.

   *  Competitiveness: Enabling organizations to maintain a competitive
      infrastructure through enhanced sustainability.

   *  Environmental Impact: Supporting broader sustainability
      initiatives by reducing carbon footprints.

   *  Simplified Implementation: Streamlining the deployment of energy-
      efficient measures to minimize service disruptions.

   *  Security: Protecting sensitive operations related to power states
      and consumption.

      This document defines an Energy Management framework for devices
      within, or connected to, communication networks, for the use cases
      described in [I-D.stephan-green-use-cases].  The devices, or the
      components of these devices (such as line cards, fans, and disks),
      can then be monitored and controlled.  Monitoring includes
      measuring power, energy, demand, and attributes of power.  Energy
      Control can be performed by setting a device's or component's
      state.  The devices monitored by this framework can be either of
      the following:

      -  consumers of energy (such as routers and computer systems) and
         components of such devices (such as line cards, fans, and
         disks)

      -  producers of energy (like an uninterruptible power supply or
         renewable energy system) and their associated components (such
         as battery cells, inverters, or photovoltaic panels)

      The framework introduces the concept of a Power Interface that is
      analogous to a network interface.  A Power Interface is defined as
      an interconnection among devices where energy can be provided,
      received, or both.

      The most basic example of Energy Management is a single device
      reporting information about itself.  In many cases, however,
      energy is not measured by the device itself but is measured
      upstream in the power distribution tree.  For example, a Power
      Distribution Unit (PDU) may measure the energy it supplies to
      attached devices and report this to an Energy Management System.
      Therefore, devices often have relationships to other devices or
      components in the power network.  An Energy Management System
      (EnMS) generally requires an understanding of the power topology
      (who provides power to whom), the Metering topology (who meters
      whom), and the potential Aggregation (who aggregates values of
      others).

      The relationships build on the Power Interface concept.  The
      different relationships among devices and components, as specified
      in this document, include power source, Metering, and Aggregation
      Relationships.

      The framework does not cover non-electrical equipment, nor does it
      cover energy procurement and manufacturing.

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.draft-bclp-green-terminology]
   and EMAN Framework [RFC7326]: Energy, Power, Energy Management,
   Energy Monitoring, Energy Control.

   The following terms are defined in EMAN Framework [RFC7326], and cut/
   paste here for completeness:

   Energy Management System (EnMS)  An Energy Management System is a
      combination of hardware and software used to administer a network,
      with the primary purpose of Energy Management.

      NOTES:

      1. An Energy Management System according to [ISO50001] (ISO-EnMS)
         is a set of systems or procedures upon which organizations can
         develop and implement an energy policy, set targets and action
         plans, and take into account legal requirements related to
         energy use.  An ISO-EnMS allows organizations to improve energy
         performance and demonstrate conformity to requirements,
         standards, and/or legal requirements.

      2. Example ISO-EnMS: Company A defines a set of policies and
         procedures indicating that there should exist multiple
         computerized systems that will poll energy measurements from
         their meters and pricing / source data from their local
         utility.  Company A specifies that their CFO (Chief Financial
         Officer) should collect information and summarize it quarterly
         to be sent to an accounting firm to produce carbon accounting
         reporting as required by their local government.

      3. For the purposes of EMAN, the definition herein is the
         preferred meaning of an EnMS.  The definition from [ISO50001]
         can be referred to as an ISO Energy Management System
         (ISO-EnMS).

   Device  A device is a piece of electrical or non-electrical
      equipment. _Reference: Adapted from [IEEE100]._

   Component  A component is a part of electrical or non-electrical
      equipment (device). _Reference: Adapted from [TMN]._

   Meter (Energy Meter)  A meter is a device intended to measure
      electrical energy by integrating power with respect to time.
      _Reference: Adapted from [IEC60050]._

   Power Inlet  A power inlet (or simply "inlet") is an interface at
      which a device or component receives energy from another device or
      component.

   Power Outlet  A power outlet (or simply "outlet") is an interface at
      which a device or component provides energy to another device or
      component.

   Power Interface  A Power Interface is a power inlet, outlet, or both.

   Power State  A Power State is a condition or mode of a device (or
      component) that broadly characterizes its capabilities, power, and
      responsiveness to input. _Reference: Adapted from [IEEE1621]._

   Power State Set  A Power State Set is a collection of Power States
      that comprises a named or logical control grouping.

   Energy Object  An Energy Object represents a piece of equipment that
      is part of, or attached to, a communications network that is
      monitored or controlled or that aids in the management of another
      device for Energy Management.

3.  Motivation

3.1.  Impact on Energy Metrics

   The framework will significantly enhance the creation of energy
   metrics with actionable insights by:

   *  Standardizing Metrics: Establishing consistent measurement
      protocols for energy consumption and efficiency.

   *  Enhancing Data Collection: Facilitating comprehensive monitoring
      and data aggregation across devices.

   *  Supporting Real-time Monitoring: Enabling dynamic tracking and
      immediate optimization of energy usage.

   *  Integration Across Devices: Ensuring interoperability for network-
      wide data analysis.

   *  Providing Actionable Insights: Translating raw data into
      meaningful information for decision-making.

3.2.  Current Device Readiness

   While many modern networking devices have basic energy monitoring
   capabilities, these are often proprietary.  The framework will define
   requirements to enhance these capabilities, enabling standardized
   metric production and meaningful data contributions for energy
   management goals.

3.3.  Why Now?

   The decision to define the framework now, rather than later, is
   driven by:

   *  Immediate Benefits: Start realizing cost savings, reduced carbon
      footprints, and improved efficiencies.

   *  Rapid Technological Advancements: Aligning the framework with
      current technologies to prevent obsolescence.

   *  Increasing Energy Demands: Mitigating the impact of growing energy
      consumption on costs and sustainability.

   *  Regulatory Pressure: Preparing for compliance with existing and
      anticipated sustainability regulations.

   *  Competitive Advantage: Positioning organizations as leaders in
      sustainability and innovation.

   *  Foundational Work Ready: Building on the use cases and
      requirements established in Phase I.

   *  Proactive Risk Management: Minimizing risks associated with energy
      costs and environmental factors.

   *  Facilitate Future Innovations: Creating a platform for continuous
      improvements and adaptations.

   *  Stakeholder Engagement: Ensuring diverse perspectives are
      reflected for broader adoption.

   In conclusion, establishing the framework for energy efficiency
   management now is strategic and timely, leveraging the current
   momentum of use cases and requirements to drive meaningful progress
   in energy efficiency management.  Delaying its development could
   result in missed opportunities for immediate benefits, increased
   costs, and challenges in adapting to future technological and
   regulatory landscapes.

4.  Reference Model

   The framework introduces the concept of a Power Interface.  A Power
   Interface is defined as an interconnection among devices where energy
   can be provided, received, or both.  There are some similarities
   between Power Interfaces and network interfaces.  A network interface
   can be set to different states, such as sending or receiving data on
   an attached line.  Similarly, a Power Interface can be receiving or
   providing energy.

   The most basic example of Energy Management is a single device
   reporting information about itself.  In many cases, however, energy
   is not measured by the device itself but is measured upstream in the
   power distribution tree.  For example, a Power Distribution Unit
   (PDU) may measure the energy it supplies to attached devices and
   report this to an Energy Management System.  Therefore, devices often
   have relationships to other devices or components in the power
   network.  An Energy Management System (EnMS) generally requires an
   understanding of the power topology (who provides power to whom), the
   Metering topology (who meters whom), and the potential Aggregation
   (who aggregates values of others).

   The relationships build on the Power Interface concept.  The
   different relationships among devices and components, as specified in
   this document, include power source, Metering, and Aggregation
   Relationships.

   The framework does not cover non-electrical equipment, nor does it
   cover energy procurement and manufacturing.

                      Figure 1: GREEN Reference Model

   The main elements in the framework are as follows:

   *  (a), (d) Discovery and Inventory

   *  (b), (c) GREEN Metrics

   *  (b), (e) Monitor energy efficiency

   *  (f) Control Energy Saving

   The monitoring interface (e) obviously monitor more aspects than just
   power and energy, (for example traffic monitoring) but this is not
   covered in the framework.

   Note that this framework specificies logical blocks, however, the
   Energy Efficiency Management Function might be implemented inside the
   device or in the controller or a combination of both.

4.1.  Typical Power Topologies

   The following reference model describes physical power topologies
   that exist in parallel with a communication topology.  While many
   more topologies can be created with a combination of devices, the
   following are some basic ones that show how Energy Management
   topologies differ from Network Management topologies.  Only the
   controller, devices and components, are depicted here, as the Network
   Domain Level remains identical.

   NOTE:

   *  "###" is used to denote a transfer of energy.

   *  "- >" is used to denote a transfer of information.

             Figure 3: Reference Model Example: Physical Meter

   When the EnMS discovers the physical meter, it must know for which
   Energy Object(s) it measures power or energy.  This is the Metering
   Relatonship.

   A Metering Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object
   measures power, energy, demand, or Power Attributes of one or more
   other Energy Objects.  The Metering Relationship gives the view of
   the Metering topology.  Physical meters can be placed anywhere in a
   power distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor and
   report accumulated power consumption of the entire building.
   Logically, the Metering topology overlaps with the wiring topology,
   as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A typical example is
   meters that clamp onto the existing wiring.

4.1.3.  Physical Meter with New Device

   This covers the example of device connected to wall Power Outlet,
   with a Physical Meter placed in the wall Power Outlet, because the
   previous device was not able to monitor its power, energy, demand.

     Figure 4: Reference Model Example: Physical Meter with New Device

   The most important issue in such a topology is to avoid the double
   counting in the Energy Management System (EnMS).  The physical meter
   reports the Energy transmitted, while the connected Device/Component
   might also report its consumed Energy.  Those two values are
   identical.  Without the knowledge of this specific topology, that is
   the Metering Relationship between the two Energy Objects, the EnMS
   will double count the Energy consumed in the network.

   Double counting is also an issue in such an example.  The switch
   port, via its Power Outlet, reports the Energy transmitted, while the
   PoE End Point, via its Power Inlet, reports its Energy consumed.

   A second issue in such an example is the control topology.  The
   controller must have the knowledge that, if it shuts down the switch
   port, it will also switch off the connected PoE End Point, as a
   consequence.  This is the Power Source Relationship.

   A Power Source Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object
   provides power to one or more Energy Objects.  The Power Source
   Relationship gives a view of the physical wiring topology -- for
   example, a PoE End Point receiving power from a switch port over PoE
   or a data center server receiving power from two specific Power
   Interfaces from two different PDUs.

   On top of that, there might be two control points for the PoE End
   Point.  First the connected switch port but also the controller
   direct connection to the PoE End Point (f).  Via this interface, the
   controller might for example put the PoE End Point to a lower Power
   State.

4.2.  Relationships

   The framework for Energy Management need to describe a means to
   monitor and control devices and components, and it needs to to
   describe the relationships among, and connections between, devices
   and components.

   Two Energy Objects can establish an Energy Object Relationship to
   model the deployment topology with respect to Energy Management.

   Relationships are modeled with a Relationship that contains the UUID
   of the other participant in the relationship, along with a
   Relationship type.

   There are three types of relationships are Power Source, Metering,
   and Aggregations.

   *  A Power Source Relationship is a relationship where one Energy
      Object provides power to one or more Energy Objects.  The Power
      Source Relationship gives a view of the physical wiring topology
      -- for example, a data center server receiving power from two
      specific Power Interfaces from two different PDUs.

      Note: A Power Source Relationship may or may not change as the
      direction of power changes between two Energy Objects.  The
      relationship may remain to indicate that the change of power
      direction was unintended or an error condition.

   *  A Metering Relationship is a relationship where one Energy Object
      measures power, energy, demand, or Power Attributes of one or more
      other Energy Objects.  The Metering Relationship gives the view of
      the Metering topology.  Physical meters can be placed anywhere in
      a power distribution tree.  For example, utility meters monitor
      and report accumulated power consumption of the entire building.
      Logically, the Metering topology overlaps with the wiring
      topology, as meters are connected to the wiring topology.  A
      typical example is meters that clamp onto the existing wiring.

   *  An Aggregation Relationship is a relationship where one Energy
      Object aggregates Energy Management information of one or more
      other Energy Objects.  The Aggregation Relationship gives a model
      of devices that may aggregate (sum, average, etc.) values for
      other devices.  The Aggregation Relationship is slightly different
      compared to the other relationships, as this refers more to a
      management function.

   In some situations, it is not possible to discover the Energy Object
   Relationships, and an EnMS or administrator must manually set them.
   Given that relationships can be assigned manually, the following
   sections describe guidelines for use.

4.3.  Power State Set

   The Energy Object contains a Power State Set attribute that
   represents the set of Power States a device or component supports.

   A Power State describes a condition or mode of a device or component.
   While Power States are typically used for control, they may be used
   for monitoring only.

   A device or component is expected to support at least one set of
   Power States consisting of at least two states: an on state and an
   off state.

   The semantics of a Power State are specified by:

   *  The functionality provided by an Energy Object in this state.

   *  A limitation of the power that an Energy Object uses in this
      state.

   *  A combination of the first two.

   The semantics of a Power State should be clearly defined.  Limitation
   (curtailment) of the power used by an Energy Object in a state may be
   specified by:

   *  An absolute power value.

   *  A percentage value of power relative to the Energy Object's
      Nameplate Power.

   *  An indication of power relative to another Power State.  For
      example, specify that power in state A is less than in state B.

   *  For supporting Power State management, an Energy Object provides
      statistics on Power States, including the time an Energy Object
      spent in a certain Power State and the number of times an Energy
      Object entered a Power State.

   There are many existing standards describing device and component
   Power States.  TO BE COMPLETED

5.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

6.  Security Considerations

   Resiliency is an implicit use case of energy efficiency management
   which comes with numerous security considerations :

   Controlling Power State and power supply of entities are considered
   highly sensitive actions, since they can significantly affect the
   operation of directly and indirectly connected devices.  Therefore,
   all control actions must be sufficiently protected through
   authentication, authorization, and integrity protection mechanisms.

   Entities that are not sufficiently secure to operate directly on the
   public Internet do exist and can be a significant cause of risk, for
   example, if the remote control functions can be exercised on those
   devices from anywhere on the Internet.

   The monitoring of energy-related quantities of an entity as addressed
   can be used to derive more information than just the received and
   provided energy; therefore, monitored data requires protection.  This
   protection includes authentication and authorization of entities
   requesting access to monitored data as well as confidentiality
   protection during transmission of monitored data.  Privacy of stored
   data in an entity must be taken into account.  Monitored data may be
   used as input to control, accounting, and other actions, so integrity
   of transmitted information and authentication of the origin may be
   needed.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
